# quickstart-cherwell
## Cherwell intergration on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys the Cherwell  connector on the AWS Cloud.

Cherwell® Service Management is a powerful, flexible IT service management (ITSM) tool that enables IT teams to implement, automate, and modernize service and support processes to meet new and evolving needs—at a fraction of the cost and complexity associated with legacy ITSM tools.

The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates to build the AWS infrastructure to connect to your Cherwell deployment using AWS's best practices. By deploying this QuickStart, AWS Config is enable in your AWS account with the recommended Config Rules, and a AWS Service Catalog is created with sample products.
